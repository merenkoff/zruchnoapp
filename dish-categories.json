It's shaped by hand into a flat, round disk, about 3 millimeters thick. After that, it's topped with ingredients and baked for 90 seconds in a blisteringly hot (around 900Â°F) wood-burning oven. The result is a soft, elastic heart with a tall, fluffy crust called the cornicione in Italian. You can find this variety at your local Eataly's La Pizza & La Pasta restaurant.",
